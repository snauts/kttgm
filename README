"Kur tu teci, GailÄ«ti manu?"

Is a Latvian folk song about a rooster and his daily duties.

This song was made into video game as a courtesy to "Retro Istaba" community.
It is intended to be run on NES/Famicom console, but to run it on a modern
computer one would need an emulator like fceux or nestopia, it also could be
ran in webish emulator https://koute.github.io/pinky-web/ without installing
anying on your host computer.

To build this game one would need to install make, cc65, imagemagick and sbcl.

Controls of this game are fairly simple:

"start" button - to start game and pause it during the game

"A" button - to jump, and second time in the air to double jump

"select" button - gives infinite lives, but also some extra hard levels
